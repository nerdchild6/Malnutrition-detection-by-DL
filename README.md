2.  **Configure Python Environment Path:**
    * Open the `malnutrition_detector_octave_gui.m` file in a text editor.
    * Find the `python_executable_path` variable.
    * Change the path to point to the `python.exe` file on your local machine (especially if you are using a virtual environment) that you have created.

    ```matlab
    % Change this path to match your system's Python executable
    python_executable_path = 'C:\Users\dataEngineer\Desktop\Malnutrition-detection-by-DL\my_env\Scripts\python.exe';
    ```

### 3. Running the Application

1.  Inside the Octave GUI, open the **Command Window**.
2.  Type the following command and press Enter:

    ```bash
    malnutrition_detector_octave_gui
    ```

3.  The application's GUI should now launch.
